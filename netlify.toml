# Netlify Configuration
# 
# This configuration is for deploying the FRONTEND ONLY to Netlify.
# For the full application to work, you need to deploy the backend separately
# (on Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.) and configure the frontend to point to it.
#
# Alternative: Use a platform that supports full-stack Node.js apps (Railway, Render)

# Note: API calls (/api/*) need to be proxied to your backend server
# Configure this in your React app's API client or use environment variables

# Environment variables for frontend build
# Set these in Netlify dashboard under Site settings > Environment variables:

# If deploying backend separately:
# - VITE_API_URL: URL of your backend API server

# If using Netlify for local development only:
